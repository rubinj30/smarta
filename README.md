Technologies used:
- [GeoLocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation)
  - After fiddling around with it and then starting to write my own custom hook, for time's sake decided to use an existing one I found on npm - [use-position](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-position)
