Technologies used:
- [Chakra UI]() - I haven't used a UI library in a long time other than the internal one our team built at Honeywell, but I knew it would be important to have one for speeding up development, as CSS can be very time-consuming. Also, I wanted to use one that worked well with styled-components or a similar library. Chakra seemed to fit this need, was easy to implement, had its own icons, and came with an easy to use ThemeSwitcher component.

- [GeoLocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation)
  - After fiddling around with it and then starting to write my own custom hook, for time's sake decided to use an existing one I found on npm - [use-position](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-position)
